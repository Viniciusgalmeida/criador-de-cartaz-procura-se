# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the React + TypeScript project with Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, React Hook Form, and other required dependencies.
# Details:
1. Create a new React project with TypeScript using Vite:
```bash
npm create vite@latest encontre-meu-amigo -- --template react-ts
```
2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
3. Configure Tailwind CSS in tailwind.config.js to include the project paths
4. Install Radix UI components:
```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-form
```
5. Install React Hook Form:
```bash
npm install react-hook-form
```
6. Set up Vitest and React Testing Library:
```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jsdom
```
7. Configure Prettier:
```bash
npm install -D prettier
```
8. Create basic project structure with folders for components, hooks, contexts, utils, and assets

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured by running a simple smoke test that renders a basic component. Ensure the build process works without errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and configure Node.js and npm [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the Node.js environment and npm package manager for the project
### Details:

2. Verify installation with 'node --version' and 'npm --version'
3. Configure npm settings (proxy, registry if needed)
4. Set up .npmrc file for project-specific configurations
5. Install nvm for managing multiple Node.js versions (optional)

## 2. Initialize React project with Create React App [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the basic React project structure using Create React App
### Details:

<info added on 2025-07-09T02:05:24.789Z>
COMPLETED - The project was initialized using Vite + React + TypeScript, which is a superior choice to the originally planned Create React App (CRA). Vite offers faster initialization, more efficient hot reloading, and better development performance. The basic structure is ready with all necessary configurations.

5. Set up pre-commit hooks with husky and lint-staged
<info added on 2025-07-09T02:05:32.387Z>
✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- ESLint is fully configured and working with React and TypeScript rules
- Lint scripts are functioning in package.json
- TODO: Install Prettier and create .prettierrc file for automatic code formatting

## 4. Set up React Router for navigation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Install and configure React Router for handling application routing
### Details:
1. Install react-router-dom
2. Set up basic route structure in App.tsx
3. Create placeholder components for main routes
4. Implement nested routing for complex views
5. Add error boundary and 404 route handling
<info added on 2025-07-09T02:05:40.515Z>
✅ COMPLETED - React Router DOM is installed and configured in App.tsx. The basic routing structure is working with BrowserRouter, Routes and Route. Implemented routes: main route ("/") for Index, catch-all route ("*") for NotFound. The routing system is ready for expansion as new pages are created.

## 5. Configure state management with Redux Toolkit [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up Redux Toolkit for efficient state management in the application
### Details:
1. Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
2. Set up store configuration with configureStore
3. Create initial slices for main data entities
4. Implement Redux hooks in components
5. Set up async thunks for API calls
<info added on 2025-07-09T02:05:07.707Z>
This subtask has been canceled because the project adopted a more modern architecture using React Query for server-side state management and Context API for local state. This approach is more suitable for modern applications than Redux Toolkit, offering better performance and lower complexity.

## Test Environment Configuration Update (2025-07-09)

### Modern Test Setup with Vitest
1. Implemented Vitest + React Testing Library instead of Jest for better Vite compatibility
2. Installed required packages:
   - Vitest (modern testing framework)
   - @testing-library/react (React component testing)
   - @testing-library/jest-dom (custom matchers)
   - @testing-library/user-event (user interaction simulation)
   - jsdom (simulated DOM environment)
   - @vitest/ui (visual test interface)

### Configuration Files
- Updated vite.config.ts with Vitest configuration and jsdom environment
- Created src/test/setup.ts with automatic mocks for:
  - matchMedia
  - ResizeObserver
  - scrollIntoView
- Updated tsconfig.app.json with Vitest type definitions
- Added test scripts to package.json:
  - test
  - test:run
  - test:ui

### Test Structure
- src/test/ - Test configuration and setup
- tests/ - Directory for specific tests
- src/test/example.test.tsx - Working example test

### Technical Rationale
Vitest was selected over Jest due to:
- Native Vite integration
- Superior performance
- Simpler configuration
- Hot Module Replacement for tests
- Full compatibility with Jest API

All tests are running successfully with proper TypeScript integration.

## 7. Configure Styled Components for styling [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up Styled Components for CSS-in-JS styling solution
### Details:
1. Install styled-components and @types/styled-components
2. Set up global styles and theme provider

<info added on 2025-07-09T02:05:16.921Z>
This subtask has been canceled because the project has adopted Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui as the styling solution. This combination offers better performance, maintainability, and productivity compared to Styled Components, while providing a consistent and accessible design system through shadcn/ui components based on Radix UI.
