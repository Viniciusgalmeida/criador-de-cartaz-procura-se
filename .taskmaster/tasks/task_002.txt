# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create Base Layout Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the responsive two-column layout that will contain the editor form on the left and the preview on the right.
# Details:
1. Create a Layout component that handles the responsive behavior:
```tsx
const Layout: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-400 via-purple-400 to-pink-400 p-4 md:p-8">
      <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl overflow-hidden">
        <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
          {children}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
2. Create EditorColumn and PreviewColumn components:
```tsx
const EditorColumn: React.FC = ({ children }) => (
  <div className="w-full md:w-1/2 p-4 md:p-6 overflow-y-auto">{children}</div>
);

const PreviewColumn: React.FC = ({ children }) => (
  <div className="w-full md:w-1/2 bg-gray-50 p-4 md:p-6 overflow-y-auto">{children}</div>
);
```
3. Implement responsive behavior that stacks columns vertically on mobile and side-by-side on desktop
4. Add header with app title and language selector

# Test Strategy:
Test the layout components with various viewport sizes to ensure they respond correctly. Verify that the columns stack on mobile and display side-by-side on desktop. Use React Testing Library to test the rendering of the components.
