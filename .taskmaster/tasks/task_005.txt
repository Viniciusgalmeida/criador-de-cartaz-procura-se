# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Pet Poster Form - Required Fields
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the form component with all required fields (pet name, owner name, contact phone, last seen location) using React Hook Form.
# Details:
1. Create a form component using React Hook Form:
```typescript
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { useFormData } from '../hooks/useFormData';
import { useLanguage } from '../hooks/useLanguage';

const PetPosterForm: React.FC = () => {
  const { t } = useLanguage();
  const { formData, updateFormData } = useFormData();
  const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm({
    defaultValues: formData
  });
  
  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    updateFormData(data);
  };
  
  return (
    <form onChange={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-6">
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="petName" className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">
          {t('form.petName')} *
        </label>
        <input
          id="petName"
          type="text"
          {...register('petName', { required: true })}
          className="mt-1 block w-full rounded-md border-gray-300 shadow-sm focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-indigo-500"
        />
        {errors.petName && <p className="text-red-500 text-xs mt-1">{t('form.required')}</p>}
      </div>
      
      {/* Similar implementation for ownerName, contactPhone, and lastSeenLocation */}
      
      {/* Submit button if needed */}
    </form>
  );
};
```
2. Implement real-time validation with visual feedback
3. Ensure all required fields have proper labels and error states
4. Make the form accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
5. Connect the form to the FormContext to ensure data is saved to localStorage

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation by submitting with empty required fields and verifying error messages. Test that valid input is correctly saved to the form context. Test keyboard accessibility to ensure the form can be navigated and submitted without a mouse.
