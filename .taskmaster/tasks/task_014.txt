# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Accessibility Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 6, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the application with accessibility features to ensure it's usable by everyone, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
# Details:
1. Add focus management and keyboard navigation:
```typescript
// Example of making a component keyboard accessible
const AccessibleButton: React.FC<{
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}> = ({ onClick, children, className }) => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className={className}
      onKeyDown={(e) => {
        if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
          onClick();
        }
      }}
      tabIndex={0}
      role="button"
      aria-pressed="false"
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```
2. Add ARIA labels and roles to all interactive elements:
```typescript
// Example of adding ARIA attributes to form fields
<label id="petNameLabel" htmlFor="petName" className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">
  {t('form.petName')} *
</label>
<input
  id="petName"
  type="text"
  aria-labelledby="petNameLabel"
  aria-required="true"
  aria-invalid={errors.petName ? 'true' : 'false'}
  {...register('petName', { required: true })}
  className="mt-1 block w-full rounded-md border-gray-300 shadow-sm focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-indigo-500"
/>
{errors.petName && (
  <p id="petNameError" className="text-red-500 text-xs mt-1" role="alert" aria-live="assertive">
    {t('form.required')}
  </p>
)}
```
3. Implement skip navigation links for keyboard users
4. Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.)
5. Add sufficient color contrast for all text and UI elements
6. Implement focus styles that are visible and consistent
7. Add screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes

# Test Strategy:
Test keyboard navigation through the entire application. Verify that all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using only the keyboard. Test with screen readers to ensure all content is properly announced. Verify that ARIA attributes are correctly implemented. Use automated accessibility testing tools like axe-core.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement keyboard navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a robust keyboard navigation system for the entire application
### Details:
Use React's useRef and useEffect hooks to manage focus. Implement custom key handlers for complex components. Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard. Test with various keyboard layouts.

## 2. Add ARIA attributes [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Integrate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes throughout the application
### Details:
Use aria-label, aria-describedby, and role attributes appropriately. Implement live regions for dynamic content updates. Ensure proper heading structure and landmark regions. Validate ARIA usage with automated tools.

## 3. Implement screen reader compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Ensure the application is fully compatible with popular screen readers
### Details:
Test with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver. Create custom announcements for complex UI interactions. Implement skip links and proper focus management. Ensure all content is read in a logical order.

## 4. Develop color contrast and visibility features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement features to enhance color contrast and visibility for users with visual impairments
### Details:
Use CSS custom properties for theming. Implement high contrast mode toggle. Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements. Add focus indicators and hover states that don't rely solely on color.

## 5. Create text alternatives for non-text content [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Provide text alternatives for all non-text content in the application
### Details:
Add alt text to all images. Implement descriptive labels for form controls. Create transcripts for audio content. Use aria-label for icons and SVGs. Ensure complex visualizations have text summaries.

## 6. Implement responsive design for various devices [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Ensure the application is accessible on different devices and screen sizes
### Details:
Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts. Implement responsive typography with rem units. Create mobile-first breakpoints. Test on various devices and screen readers. Ensure touch targets are large enough for mobile use.

## 7. Develop accessibility testing suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6
### Description: Create a comprehensive testing suite for accessibility features
### Details:
Integrate axe-core for automated testing. Write unit tests for keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes. Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress for screen reader compatibility. Create a checklist for manual testing of all WCAG success criteria.

## 8. Document accessibility features and guidelines [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.7
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for all implemented accessibility features
### Details:
Document keyboard shortcuts and navigation patterns. Create guidelines for content creators on writing alt text and captions. Provide examples of accessible component usage. Include a section on known limitations and workarounds.
